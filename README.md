# The Wild Oasis Hotel Management System

This simple project is my first attempt at creating a frontend website with a working backend using React and Supabase.

## Disclaimer

This website has been built with the help of the Udemy course: ["The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. I extend my gratitude to the instructor for his guidance throughout the development process.

## About the Website

"The Wild Oasis" is a hotel management system designed for the staff of the hotel to streamline their operations. Here are some key features:

1. **Employee Access**: Only hotel employees can access the system to manage guest check-ins and check-outs.
2. **Cabin Management**: Employees can manage a fixed number of cabins with the ability to add more in the future.
3. **Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard displays today's check-ins and check-outs, along with sales and guest statistics through an Area Chart and a Pie Chart.
4. **Bookings and Cabins**: Dedicated pages for managing bookings and cabin details.
5. **User Authentication**: Secure login and sign-up pages for employee authentication.
6. **Dark Mode**: An interface that adapts to your system's settings for comfortable viewing.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
